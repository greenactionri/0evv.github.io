[*twelfth key*](https://0evv.github.io) is my personal website. I am a biologist, cyclist, and runner, and hold a B.Sc. in Biological Sciences. I am also the founder of an environmental advocacy organization, [Green Action Rhode Island](https://greenactionri.github.io)[^1].

Apart from my interests in the sciences, which include, but are not limited to, natural products, ecology, and environmental science; I am very interested in education and the process of learning. My intention in writing the articles found here is twofold: to educate the reader on the topic, and, with just as much importance, to educate myself. To the best of my ability, the articles aim to be well-researched, accessible, and factually accurate; each scientific article aims to be a single, cohesive work, knitting together the data and conclusions of multiple studies to create a more complete picture of the topic at hand.

Apart from these formal works, the reader can find additional, off-topic articles under the tag "musings." Writings under that heading will usually be about things outside of the sciences, though I may sneak one science-related piece in from time to time. This site will never contain political messages, which I hope the reader will appreciate. There are few places on the Web where one can read something without the author's own political bias entering into the dialogue, and this is one such place.

Happy reading,

E.V.
