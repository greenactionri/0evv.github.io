[*twelfth key*](https://0evv.github.io) is my personal website. I am a biologist, cyclist, and runner, and hold a B.Sc. in Biological Sciences from [the University of Rhode Island](https://uri.edu/). The name "twelfth key" is a reference to the twelve keys of the Philosopher's stone, with the twelfth key allowing the alchemist, with knowledge of its use, to "compose the Stone" and turn lead into gold[^1].

On this site the reader will find articles on different topics in biology, chemistry, sport science, and history - these are the subjects I am most passionate about. To the best of my ability, the articles aim to be well-researched, accessible, and factually accurate.

I am also the founder of an environmental advocacy organization, [Green Action Rhode Island](https://greenactionri.github.io) (G.A.R.I.)[^2].

Happy reading,
E.V.
