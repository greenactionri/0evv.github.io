[*twelfth key*](https://0evv.github.io) is the personal website of Elliot Vosburgh. The writings contained herein seek to be well-researched, accessible, and factually accurate - it is hoped that the reader will appreciate them as they were written, as an outlet for creativity and knowledge-gaining. 

I am a biologist with research interests in pollution science and ecology, and a graduate of the [University of Rhode Island](https://uri.edu/).

Where relevant, additional information will be appended to the article in the form of footnotes, where the interested reader can further satisfy their intellectual hunger. I firmly believe that scientific papers, produced by public grants, should always be made available, gratis, to anyone, regardless of their academic status or institutional affiliation. In that vein, additional sources will, whenever possible, be available to read without access to a university library. As will be seen, this is not always possible, and it is frustrating to weigh breaking copyright law, by circumventing paywalls in any number of ways that I most definitely do not condone nor encourage the reader to do, to simply read beyond the abstract of a study. It's left to the reader to decide how they want to access locked content. Through my *alma mater*'s network I have access to a number of academic journals - [PLOS](https://plos.org/) is an excellent source, and many top publishers have open-access journals alongside their pay-to-read content.
