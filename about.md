[*twelfth key*](https://0evv.github.io) is my personal website. I am a biologist, cyclist, and runner, and hold a B.Sc. in Biological Sciences from [the University of Rhode Island](https://uri.edu/). I am also the founder of an environmental advocacy organization, [Green Action Rhode Island](https://greenactionri.github.io)[^1].

On this site the reader will find articles on different topics in biology, chemistry, sport science, and history - these are the subjects I am most passionate about. To the best of my ability, the articles aim to be well-researched, accessible, and factually accurate.

Happy reading,

E.V.
