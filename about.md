[*twelfth key*](https://0evv.github.io) is my personal website. I am a biologist, and a graduate of [the University of Rhode Island](https://uri.edu/) with resesearch interests in pollution science. The scope of the writings on this site will go beyond that single area, and venture further into biology, chemistry, and history.

The writings contained herein seek to be well-researched, accessible, and factually accurate - it is hoped that the reader will appreciate them as they were written, as an outlet for creativity and knowledge-gaining. The name "twelfth key" is a reference to the twelve keys of the Philosopher's stone, with the twelfth key allowing the alchemist, with knowledge of its use, to "compose the Stone" and turn lead into gold.

Where relevant, additional information will be appended to the article in the form of footnotes, where the interested reader can further satisfy their intellectual hunger. I firmly believe that scientific papers, produced by public grants, should always be made available, gratis, to anyone, regardless of their academic status or institutional affiliation. In that vein, additional sources will, whenever possible, be available to read without access to a university library. As will be seen, this is not always possible, and it is frustrating to weigh breaking copyright law, by circumventing paywalls in any number of ways that I most definitely do not condone nor encourage the reader to do, to simply read beyond the abstract of a study. It's left to the reader to decide how they want to access locked content. Through my *alma mater*'s network I have access to a number of academic journals.

I don't have a specific timeframe for writing articles; time between posts could vary from a week to several weeks. The homepage lists posts by publication date - the first listed post will always be the most recent. If you want to organize articles by subject, please visit [this page](https://0evv.github.io/tags/). The subject of an article depends on what I'm interested in at that time, and browsing by tags gives the reader who is only interested in, for example, chemistry, a way to do so.

Happy reading,

E.V.
