[*twelfth key*](https://0evv.github.io) is my personal website. I am a biologist with resesearch interests in pollution science, and a graduate of [the University of Rhode Island](https://uri.edu/) The scope of the writings on this site will go beyond that single area, and venture further into biology, chemistry, and history.

The writings contained herein seek to be well-researched, accessible, and factually accurate - it is hoped that the reader will appreciate them as they were written, as an outlet for creativity and knowledge-gaining. The name "twelfth key" is a reference to the twelve keys of the Philosopher's stone, with the twelfth key allowing the alchemist, with knowledge of its use, to "compose the Stone" and turn lead into gold [^1].

Where relevant, additional information will be appended to the article in the form of footnotes, where the interested reader can further satisfy their intellectual hunger. I firmly believe that scientific papers, produced by public grants, should always be made available, gratis, to anyone, regardless of their academic status or institutional affiliation. In that vein, additional sources will, whenever possible, be available to read without access to a university library. As will be seen, this is not always possible, and it is frustrating to weigh breaking copyright law, by circumventing paywalls in any number of ways that I most definitely do not condone nor encourage the reader to do, to simply read beyond the abstract of a study. It's left to the reader to decide how they want to access locked content. Through my *alma mater*'s network I have access to a number of academic journals.

I don't have a specific timeframe for writing articles; time between posts could vary from a week to several weeks. The homepage lists posts by publication date - the first listed post will always be the most recent. If you want to organize articles by subject, please visit [this page](https://0evv.github.io/tags/). The subject of an article depends on what I'm interested in at that time, and browsing by tags gives the reader who is only interested in, for example, chemistry, a way to do so.

I am the founder of an environmental advocacy organization, [Green Action Rhode Island](https://greenactionri.github.io) (G.A.R.I.) [^2]. We are interested in promoting a greener, healthier future for Rhode Island, and endeavor to do so by calling attention to "action spots," where litter, dumping, and runoff have the most serious ecological consequences to the State's ecosphere [^3]. Please visit that site to learn more about our efforts to clean our State up through citizen action.

Happy reading,

E.V.

[^2]: As of 14 April 2020, the site is under construction and is offline. G.A.R.I. expects the site to return online within the next month.
[^3]: Currently, G.A.R.I. is looking at different A.P.I.'s to integrate into its website, which will allow users to identify their own action spots on a community map. The G.A.R.I. network hopes to use a tool like this to efficiently highlight trouble areas and organize relief efforts. Current identification is a observer-to-coordinator method, whereby observers are disconnected from each other and the coordinators are responsible for alerting the network.
