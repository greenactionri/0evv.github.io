On this site the reader will find articles on different topics in biology, chemistry, sport science, and history - these are the subjects I am most passionate about, and I hope the reader will find them enjoyable. 

The writings contained herein seek to be well-researched, accessible, and factually accurate - it is hoped that the reader will appreciate them as they were written, as an outlet for creativity and knowledge-gaining.

The name "twelfth key" is a reference to the twelve keys of the Philosopher's stone, with the twelfth key allowing the alchemist, with knowledge of its use, to "compose the Stone" and turn lead into gold [^1].

I am the founder of an environmental advocacy organization, [Green Action Rhode Island](https://greenactionri.github.io) (G.A.R.I.) [^2]. Please visit that site to learn more about our efforts to clean up Rhode Island through citizen action.

Happy reading,

E.V.
