*Hafa kváðu mig meiðar
málmþings, er kom eg hingað,
mér samir láð fyr lýðum
lasta, drykk hinn basta.
Bílds hattar verðr byttu
beiði-Týr að reiða.
Heldr er svo að eg krýp að keldu,
komat vín á grön mína.*

>   Eirik's thralls cause a landslip on the estate of Valthjof, at  Valthjofsstadr. Eyjolf the Foul, his kinsman, slew the thralls beside Skeidsbrekkur. ... In return Eirik slew Eyjolf the Foul; he slew also Hrafn the Dueller, at Leikskalar. Gerstein, and Odd of Jorfi, kinsman of Eyjolf, were found willing to  follow up his death by a legal prosecution; and then was Eirik banished  from Haukadalr.
>
>   Eirik and his people were outlawed at *Þórsnes-Thing*. He prepared a ship in Eiriksvagr [lit. Eirik's Bay], and Eyjolf concealed him in Dimunarvagr while Thorgest and his people sought him among the islands. Eirik said to his people that he purposed to seek for the land which  Gunnbjorn, the son of Ulf the Crow, saw when he was driven westwards  over the ocean, and discovered Gunnbjarnarsker [lit. Gunnbjorn's skerries].
>
>   ... then he sailed oceanwards under Snæfellsjökull [lit. Snow-fell glacier], and arrived at the glacier called Blaserkr [purported to be a glacier on Greenland's eastern coast]; thence he  journeyed south to see if there were any inhabitants of the country.
>
>   He passed the first winter at Eiriksey [lit. Eirik's Isle] ... The following spring he proceeded to Eiriksfjordr [now called Brattahlíð, anglicized Brattahlid], and fixed his abode there. During the summer he proceeded into the unpeopled districts in  the west, and was there a long time, giving names to the places far and  wide. The second winter he passed in Eiriksholmar, off Hvarfsgnupr; and the third summer he went altogether northwards, to Snæfell and into Hrafnsfjordr; considering then that he had come to the head of Eiriksfjordr, he turned back, and passed the third winter in Eiriksey, before the mouth of  Eiriksfjordr.

>   In the summer Eirik went to live in the land which he had discovered, and which he called Greenland, "Because," said he, "men will desire much the more to go there if the land has a good name."

So begins the Saga of Eirik the Red (*Eiríks saga rauða*), which relates the establishment of permanent settlements in Greenland in the late 10<sup>th</sup> century. The reader will undoubtedly be aware of Denmark's present-day possession of the island; it is one of the last vestiges of monarchal European territory on the continent, and the control the Danes have over it is directly inherited from those Norsemen who braved its settlement over a thousand years ago.

>   A note to the reader: hereafter I will anglicize *Eirik* as "Erik," both to ease the strain of English-speaking readers and to maintain some continuity with the anglicizations of other names, chiefly Leif Erikson. Additionally, I have provided footnotes to sources and additional information; be aware that some articles may be locked behind a publisher's paywall - I have tried my best to provide open-source information, as I always will in future writings.

With the naming and settlement of Greenland, Erik the Red opened the doors to the exploration of North America nearly 500 years before Christopher Columbus did in 1492. In later articles, I will discuss the implications and theories made by certain ethnographers and historians as to pre-Norse exploration of the Americas, but for now will satisfy myself to write solely on the footsteps of the Norse.
