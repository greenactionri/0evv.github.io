The nature of sleep has often been referred to as one of life’s “supreme mysteries;” the origins of rest-states, and the selective pressures driving them, remain one of the great secrets of nature (Kavanau 2006). One can easily ascribe reasons behind sleep, especially in higher level organisms: memory consolidation, muscle healing, and so on; but what of the reasons behind sleep in invertebrate animals? <img src="/assets/16april2020/Metazoan_Phylogenetic_Tree.png" alt="Phylogenetic tree of Metazoa" width="290" align="left" style="border:1px solid black"/>
Would understanding those causes not help clear the fog surrounding this behavior?

Despite constituting the majority of life on Earth, relatively little is understood about invertebrate sleep. Research over the last several decades has proved illuminating, with rest-states being found in both *Ecdysozoa* and *Cnidaria* (Sauer et al. 2003; Nath et al. 2017; Hoadley et al. 2016; Hut & Beersma 2011). The latter phylum represents some of the most ancient lineages of extant animals - their ancestry can be traced back 500 million years ago to the Cambrian period. *Medusozoa*, a subphylum of *Cnidaria*, has made headlines recently in several studies which documented sleep-like behaviors. Given how ancient these creatures are, their sleep may be one of life’s first, if not the earliest, to have been selected for.

To better understand the phenomenon of sleep in these animals, studies must reconcile their behavior with both their ecology and their phylogenetic relationships [Note the placement of *Cnidaria* in the phylogenetic tree, on the left]. In this article, we give opinions on current research into *Medusozoan* sleep, and propose where future research may best be focused to further illuminate the topic.

##### The function and origins of sleep in *Medusozoa*

In his 1975 paper, Meddis described two theories on the function of sleep in animals: first, referenced as the “recuperation theory,” states “that sleep serves the function of physiological recuperation;” whereas his “immobilization” theory states that sleep exists only to immobilize the organism and ensure that recuperation through rest can be obtained (Meddis 1975). Our knowledge on the usefulness of sleep has developed significantly since 1975, yet these two theories still serve as the baselines for many arguments on the selective pressures of sleep.

To understand the origins of rest-states in *Medusozoa*, one must first understand the anatomy governing their behavior. Jellyfish have primitive nerve nets composed of neurons. Connected to the nerve net are the various sensory structures of the organism, whose amount and type vary greatly between classes. These structures may detect light, chemicals, flow, and orientation depending on how derived the species is.

Subscribing to this theory of immobilization, it can be postulated that sleep is an involuntary response in *Medusozoa*, allowing the organism to automatically conserve energy and undergo biological processes which may be hindered or impossible to perform during waking periods. Some of the classes within this subphylum [e.g. *Cubomedusae*] have complex visual structures which demand high amounts of energy. Kavanau 2006 suggests that because predation in these types of jellyfish requires such high amounts of energy, “non-urgent processes” unrelated to food capture were relegated to a rest-state; in a word, he suggests the selective pressure for sleep was efficiency.

In the same paper, Kavanau discusses jellyfish sleep in relation to evolution. The author is in agreement with Kavanau when he says that sleep must ultimately have evolved successively from simpler parts - as with any biological feature, behavioral or physical, various pressures acted on increasingly derived forms of the trait to give the present form. Similarly, the characteristic nerve net of *Medusozoa* must have evolved from more primitive parts; a system of neurons must come from a single neuron, and a single neuron from some precursor, etc. (Watanabe et al. 2009). For sleep, a precursor in may have been photoperiod. Retention of genes from cyanobacteria allowed early *Cnidaria* to adapt to the solar and lunar cycles, and it is this first piece which may have set their lineage on a path to rest (Hut & Beersma 2011; Hoadley et al. 2016).

Taken together, if energy demanding traits and sleep compliment each other, it makes sense to suggest that they coevolved. If they coevolved, it can be postulated that as neural complexity and demands increase so too does the need for increasingly complex rest-states. The best example one can give is that of human sleep: the multiple phases undergone must be linked directly to the derived nervous system we possess. In comparison, the rest-states observed in jellyfish are simple. They can be awakened briefly and return to sleep, but there is not a definite need for sleep so long as light and food are continuously present (Nath et al. 2017; Seymour et al. 2004).

##### *C. fleckeri*: a case study

In the wild, Seymour et al. observed individuals laying directly on the seafloor, completely motionless and without “bell pulsation.” They describe the jellyfish exhibiting this sleep-state for 15 continuous hours, from 3:00 PM to 6:00 AM. Movement during this period was less than 10 meters per hour, whereas movement during the day 6:00 AM to 3:00 PM was about 212 meters per hour (Seymour et al. 2004). Given *C. fleckeri*’s geographical range, from the southern coast of Thailand to the northern coast of Australia, where high island mountains provide shading, these times coincide with the sun descending in mid-afternoon and its ascent in early morning.

Looking to future research, note that they are also marvelous swimmers, with some authors venturing as far as to call them “honorary fish” (Hartwick 1991; Conway Morris 2009). As Seymour et al. reported, mean waking-period speed was around 212 meters per hour, or about 1 meter per 20 seconds. Compared with other classes of jellyfish, who are less agile and whose movements are governed largely by ocean currents, cubozoans present optimal subjects for future observation of jellyfish sleep; the disparity in observed speed between waking and resting leaves little room for confusing the two activities. This species may prove useful in future wild studies.

##### *Cassiopea*: examining the need for sleep

A more recent paper examined circadian cycling in the upside-down jellyfish, *Cassiopea spp*. Although still within the *Acraspeda* lineage, containing *C. fleckeri* and other classes which have rhopalia, the class containing *Cassiopea*, *Rhizostomeae*, lacks complex eyes. Ocelli are present, and this particular genus also contains zooxanthellae that contribute to the overall carbon budget of the organism (Verde & McCloskey 1998; Richards & Collins 2009).

In their study, Nath et al. exposed three groups of *Cassiopea* to 12 hours of low light, followed by 12 hours of full intensity light. After this initial 24 hours each group was exposed to 36 hours of low-intensity, mid-intensity, and full-intensity light respectively. Activity levels were judged by bell-pulsation rates.

<img src="/assets/16april2020/Symbiodinium.png" alt="Symbiodinium spp. under the microscope" width="185" align="right" style="border:1px solid black"/> The results showed that circadian cycling was not present in this genus. When kept in low-intensity light, activity levels continued to decrease over time. Conversely, when exposed to mid- and full-intensity light activity levels continued to increase and then stabilized after 24-hours (Nath et al. 2017). Does their symbiotic relationship with *Symbiodinium spp*. algae govern when rest takes place? If left in continual darkness would these jellyfish continue to rest until they starved to death? Future research concerning sleep and algal symbionts is needed to answer these questions, and the results of those future studies could shed light on sleep in other phyla with symbiotic relationships such as *Mollusca*.

##### Concluding remarks

As it stands, the reasons behind sleep in *Medusozoa* remain veiled; the rest-state remains one of life’s “supreme mysteries.” However, as new tools for activity measurement and observation become available, and the knowledge of neural networks in these animals increases, a growing number of scientists will work to unravel this behavioral oddity.

One must consider that the most parsimonious explanation for our own retention of sleep, as mammals, is that natural selection selected for rest-states in our invertebrate ancestors. By piecing together this puzzle of selective pressures we can better hope to understand the evolution of this behavior and its ultimate reason for existence in our lineage. At present, one of the best research subjects is *Medusozoa*, due to the age of its lineage. Continuing to study its sleep habits allows us to glimpse further into the past and demystify one of the great questions in animal behavior.
